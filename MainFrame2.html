            <h2>A turtle hatchery is a facility that provides a safe environment for sea turtle eggs to hatch, protecting them from natural and human threats. Once the hatchlings are born, they are kept in the hatchery until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean, contributing to the conservation of endangered sea turtles.</h2>

            <h2>It is very important that you differentiate these little creatures. Get this all turtles are tortoises but not all tortoises are turtles. Didn't get it? its okay. Turtles are more adapted to sea and spend most of their time underwater while tortoises even tho they are amphibious they prefer solid ground like us. Ultimately turtles due to their lifestyle have a more streamline and narrow body compared to tortoises that help them maintain agility under water.</h2>
